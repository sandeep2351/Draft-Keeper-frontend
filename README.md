🐛 Troubleshooting
🔹 Firebase Authentication Error

If you encounter this error:
FirebaseError: Firebase: Error (auth/unauthorized-domain)
➡ Solution: Add your deployed domain (draft-keeper-frontend.vercel.app) to the Authorized Domains list in Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings.



🔹 CORS Issue
If requests to the backend are blocked:
Access to fetch at 'https://draft-keeper-backend.onrender.com/api' has been blocked by CORS policy
➡ Solution: Update your backend's CORS settings to allow https://draft-keeper-frontend.vercel.app.
